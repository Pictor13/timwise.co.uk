Hi, I'm Tim Abell (one of many, but not the
[actor](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008543/) or the [other software
dev](https://twitter.com/timabell)).

* I build software.
* I'm based near [Reading,
  UK](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.449&mlon=-0.972#map=8/51.449/-0.972).
* I like helping our government do [better digital
  things](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology).
* I like building things in smart, agile teams who don't take any shit and get
  things done.
* I also like working solo.
* I created [SQL Schema Explorer](http://schemaexplorer.io/>) and
  [ef-enum-to-lookup nuget
  package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ef-enum-to-lookup).
* I'm learning to be an
  [entrepreneur](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/).

## About Charm Consulting Ltd

Charm Consulting provides ASP.NET software engineering and consulting services
on a contract basis.

## About Me (Tim Abell)

I specialize in C# / ASP.NET MVC projects, both legacy & greenfield. I bring
full-stack skills, with an emphasis on back-end technologies.

I’ve focussed on programming projects and roles since graduating in 2000 with a
degree in Cybernetics & Control Engineering from Reading University, I shifted
from permanent jobs to contracting in 2012.

Some of the principles I bring to my work are: honesty (even when it’s hard),
best practices, communication, quality, elegance, practicality and continuous
improvement.  [Read more about my approach to

I have a broad interest in programming and business and am always doing
something beyond client work. I recently completed <a
href="http://schemaexplorer.io/">http://schemaexplorer.io/</a> which is a
side-project written in GoLang.
